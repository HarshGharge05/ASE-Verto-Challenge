# üõí ASE Verto Challenge ‚Äî Advanced E-Commerce Microservices Solution

- This project was developed as part of the Verto Hackathon Shortlisting Challenge, where the goal was to build a simple shopping cart system.
- I extended the task into a fully containerized, microservices-based e-commerce architecture to demonstrate scalability, reliability, and production-ready design.
## üéØ Challenge Overview

Given Task (by Verto) : "Build a minimal e-commerce site to list products and manage a shopping cart".

Core Requirements   
- Backend endpoints for:
    -  Listing hardcoded products
    - Accepting a cart order and logging it

- Frontend for:
    - Viewing products
    - Adding items to cart
    - Managing cart state and checkout

Bonus Points
- Editable quantities
- Persist cart in localStorage
- Basic backend tests
## üí° My Implementation

- I reimagined the challenge using Spring Boot microservices, ReactJS frontend, and Docker for containerized deployment.
- The system follows a distributed architecture with authentication, fault tolerance, async messaging, and centralized API management.
## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

‚öôÔ∏è Backend Microservices

- API Gateway : Routes client requests and provides global Swagger API documentation
- Auth Server (Keycloak) : Handles authentication and authorization using OAuth2
- Product Service : Manages product catalog and product-related APIs
- Order Service : Processes orders, interacts with Inventory and Notification services
- Inventory Service : Maintains stock and synchronizes with Order Service
- Notification Service : Sends notifications asynchronously using Kafka

- Key Components
    - Spring Boot Microservices
    - Spring Cloud Gateway
    - Resilience4J for Circuit Breakers and Fault Tolerance
    - Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication
    - PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data persistence
    - OpenAPI/Swagger for REST API documentation
    - Docker for containerization
    - Keycloak for authentication and role-based access control

üíª Frontend (ReactJS)

- Features
    - User authentication via Keycloak
    - Product listing and search functionality
    - Add to Cart and Place Order flows
    - Cart and Order management pages
    - Token interceptor for refreshing expired access tokens
    - User Profile modal and logout functionality
    - Custom branding (logo and name)
